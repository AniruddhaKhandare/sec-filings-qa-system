# Architecture Overview

## System Design Philosophy

The SEC Filings QA System follows a modular, pipeline-based architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Loose Coupling**: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
3. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together
4. **Extensibility**: New components can be easily added or existing ones replaced
