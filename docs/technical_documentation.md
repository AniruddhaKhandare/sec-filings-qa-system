# SEC Filings QA System - Technical Documentation

## Executive Summary

This system provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing SEC filings to answer complex financial research questions. It combines modern NLP techniques with robust document processing to handle the complexity and nuance of financial information while maintaining source attribution and handling uncertainty appropriately.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SECDataFetcher**: Handles data acquisition from SEC EDGAR
2. **DocumentProcessor**: Processes and chunks SEC filings intelligently  
3. **QueryProcessor**: Parses user queries to extract context and intent
4. **VectorStore**: Manages semantic embeddings using ChromaDB
5. **HybridRetriever**: Combines semantic and keyword-based retrieval
6. **AnswerGenerator**: Synthesizes responses with proper attribution
7. **SECQASystem**: Orchestrates all components

### Key Design Decisions

#### Query Processing Strategy
The system handles three main query types:
- **Ticker-Based**: Single company queries (e.g., "Apple's risk factors")
- **Comparative**: Multi-company analysis (e.g., "Compare Apple and Microsoft revenues")  
- **Temporal**: Time-based analysis (e.g., "How has revenue guidance changed over time?")
- **Multi-Dimensional**: Complex queries combining ticker + time + document type

#### Document Chunking Approach
- **Structure Preservation**: Maintains SEC filing section boundaries
- **Metadata Attachment**: Each chunk includes ticker, filing type, date, and section
- **Overlap Strategy**: 200-token overlap between chunks to preserve context
- **Size Optimization**: 1000-token chunks balance context and retrieval precision

#### Retrieval Strategy
**Hybrid Search Combining:**
- **Semantic Search**: Uses sentence transformers for conceptual matching
- **Keyword Search**: TF-IDF for exact term matching
- **Metadata Filtering**: Filters by ticker, filing type, and date ranges
- **Score Fusion**: Weighted combination (70% semantic, 30% keyword)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Pipeline

```
SEC EDGAR API → Document Download → HTML Parsing → Section Extraction →
